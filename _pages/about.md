I am a 5th year PhD candidate at UC Berkeley in the Department of Civil and Environmental engineering. 

I am interested in mechanistic modeling of environmental processes, from fluid mechanics to carbon cycling!

My dissertation work has focused on 2 main areas:\
1) Thermodynamic theory of microbial carbon cyling in soil\
2) Salinity intrusion modeling in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta

I want to better understand the flows of mass and energy in the environment to improve Earth system model predictions and help humans prepare for an uncertain climate future.
